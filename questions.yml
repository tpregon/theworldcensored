  title: How does Instagram censor nudity?
  description: Some images on Instagram are reported and, in some cases, removed. Users may then try to reupload their images in their original form, or attempt to pixelate, blur, and remove certain elements to comply with Instagram’s policy. You’ll see a collection of images demonstrating how nudity is censored, for example the censoring of female nipples, artworks, and wellbeing and mastectomy posts. Images with the green background are viewed by Instagram as “appropriate”, and images with a red background “go against [Instagram’s] community guidelines”.
