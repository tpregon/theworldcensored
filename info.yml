title: The World Censored
subtitle: An insight to censorship within social media, discussing covid-19 and nudity within the parameters of Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram.  

description: The most popular social media platforms, most of which are run by U.S. companies, have similar content moderation policies. They bar posts that glorify or encourage violence and panic; posts that are sexually explicit; and posts that contain hate speech, which they define as attacking a person for their race, gender, or sexual orientation, among other characteristics. The major platforms have also taken steps to limit disinformation, including by fact-checking posts, labelling the accounts of state-run media, and banning political ads. Scoial media platforms are private companies, and can censor what people post on their websites as they see fit. But given their growing role in public discourse, it's important to ask ourselves- what exactly are their censorship policies? How do they compare to each other and how much authority is retained over internet censorhip?
             A story will be telling in this page explaing covid censorship within Facebook and Reddit and an insight to censorship of nudity within instagram.
